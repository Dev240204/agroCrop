        <p>Objectives of the Sub-Mission on Plant Protection and Plant Quarantine:
        <ul>

            <li>Pest Surveillance and Monitoring: The SMPPQ aims to establish an effective pest surveillance and
                monitoring system to detect and monitor the incidence of pests, diseases, and invasive species in
                agricultural crops. This helps in early identification and timely response to pest outbreaks.</li>

            <li>Integrated Pest Management (IPM): The mission promotes the adoption of Integrated Pest Management
                practices, which involve the use of a combination of pest control methods such as biological
                control, cultural practices, and judicious use of pesticides. The objective is to minimize the use
                of chemical pesticides and promote sustainable pest management approaches.</li>

            <li>Pest Risk Analysis and Plant Quarantine: The SMPPQ focuses on strengthening plant quarantine
                measures to prevent the introduction and spread of pests and diseases through international and
                domestic trade. It involves conducting pest risk analysis, establishing quarantine facilities, and
                implementing quarantine regulations to safeguard agricultural crops.</li>

            <li>Capacity Building and Training: The mission emphasizes the capacity building of farmers, extension
                workers, and other stakeholders in the areas of pest identification, pest management techniques, and
                plant quarantine procedures. Training programs, workshops, and demonstrations are conducted to
                enhance knowledge and skills.</li>

            <li>Research and Development: The SMPPQ supports research and development activities related to plant
                protection, pest management, and plant quarantine. This includes the development of pest-resistant
                crop varieties, innovative pest control technologies, and effective plant quarantine measures.</li>

            <li>Public Awareness and Information Dissemination: The mission focuses on creating public awareness
                about the importance of plant protection, pest management, and plant quarantine. Information
                dissemination is done through various channels, including awareness campaigns, publications,
                websites, and mobile applications.</li>
