        <p>Key Components of the National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture:
        <ul>
            <li>Conservation Agriculture: The mission emphasizes the adoption of conservation agriculture practices such
                as minimum tillage, mulching, and crop residue management to improve soil health, conserve water, and
                reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</li>

            <li>Water Use Efficiency: Efficient use of water resources is crucial for sustainable agriculture. The NMSA
                promotes the adoption of technologies and practices for efficient irrigation, water harvesting, and
                conservation to address water scarcity and reduce water wastage.</li>

            <li>Seed Treatment and Management: The mission focuses on promoting quality seeds, seed treatment, and
                effective seed management practices to enhance crop productivity and resilience.</li>

            <li> Integrated Nutrient Management: Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) approaches, including the
                judicious use of organic and inorganic fertilizers, are encouraged to improve soil fertility, reduce
                nutrient imbalances, and minimize environmental impacts.</li>

            <li>Pest Management: The NMSA supports the adoption of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques to
                minimize chemical pesticide usage and promote the use of biological control methods, crop rotation, and
                resistant varieties to manage pests and diseases effectively.</li>

            <li>Farm Machinery and Equipment: The mission aims to promote the use of appropriate farm machinery and
                equipment for efficient and sustainable agricultural operations, including precision farming techniques
                and mechanization.</li>

            <li>Capacity Building and Training: The NMSA emphasizes the capacity building of farmers, extension workers,
                and other stakeholders through training programs, workshops, and demonstrations to promote awareness and
                adoption of sustainable agricultural practices.</li>

            <li>Market Linkages: The mission recognizes the importance of market access and fair prices for farmers. It
                supports the establishment of market infrastructure, value addition, and market linkages to enhance
                farmers' incomes and promote sustainable agricultural livelihoods.</li>

            <li> Climate Resilient Practices: Given the increasing vulnerability of agriculture to climate change
                impacts, the NMSA focuses on promoting climate-resilient practices such as crop diversification,
                agroforestry, and agroecology to enhance farmers' adaptive capacity.</li>

            <li> Research and Development: The mission emphasizes research and development activities to generate
                knowledge, innovation, and technologies for sustainable agriculture. It supports collaborative research
                efforts and the dissemination of research findings to stakeholders</li>
        </ul>
