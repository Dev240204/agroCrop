## Tech Stack Used in application

- The app is build using on the node platform and we have used MERN stack for devloping the web-based application.
- We have build frontend platform on the React.
- Backend is build on node platform and it uses exoress for the backend connectivity.
- SQL database is used for managing the data of the app.
- For the ML prediction we have prepared model for the crop prediction and the model uses image for predicting the disease of the crop.
