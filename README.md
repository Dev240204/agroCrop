# AgroCrop

## Need and Usage

AgroCrop is a crop disease prediction app designed to enhance farmers' ability to monitor, detect, and manage crop diseases effectively, leading to improved crop yields, reduced losses, and sustainable agricultural practices.

The app utilizes image recognition technology to predict crop diseases based on uploaded images of crops. It provides detailed analysis of the disease and suggests appropriate measures for treatment and prevention.

## Our Project: AgroCrop

AgroCrop is a comprehensive solution for providing information about crop diseases, their analysis, and potential cures. The app also offers guidance on proper crop cultivation practices.

## Aim

The aim of AgroCrop is to provide accurate and timely information about crop diseases, their analysis, and effective treatments. By doing so, it empowers farmers to make informed decisions and take proactive measures to protect their crops.

## Usage

The AgroCrop app offers various features to assist farmers in managing crop diseases. Here's how to use the application:

1. Open the AgroCrop app on your device.
2. Sign in using your credentials or create a new account if you don't have one.
3. Capture or upload an image of the crop you want to analyze.
4. Submit the image for disease prediction and analysis.
5. Wait for the app to process the image and provide the results.
6. Review the detailed analysis of the detected disease, including its characteristics, potential causes, and recommended treatments.
7. Access additional resources and information related to the disease, such as related research papers, pest control methods, and best practices for disease management.
8. Utilize the app's features for tracking disease outbreaks, monitoring weather conditions, and receiving personalized recommendations for preventive measures and treatment options.

## Tech Stack Used in application

Front-end:
- React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux: State management library for managing application state and data flow.
- React Router: Routing library for handling navigation within the app.
- HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the user interface.
- JavaScript: The primary programming language for implementing front-end logic.

Back-end:
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
- Express.js: Web application framework for building APIs and handling server-side logic.
- SQL Database: Choose a SQL database management system like MySQL to store crop disease data, user information, and other relevant data.
- Sequelize: Node.js ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for interacting with SQL databases using JavaScript.
- RESTful API: Design and implement RESTful endpoints for handling data retrieval, processing, and storage.

AI/ML:
- Image Recognition: Utilize AI/ML frameworks and libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch to build and train image recognition models for crop disease prediction based on input images.
- OpenCV: Computer vision library for image preprocessing, feature extraction, and other image-related tasks.
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Implement machine learning algorithms like decision trees, random forests, or deep learning models for disease prediction based on the extracted image features.

Other tools and libraries:
- Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests from the front-end to the back-end.
